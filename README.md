# PyBer Analysis Final Report

## Overview of the analysis

### Purpose
On this report we will show the Data Analysis performed to rides and cities data for Pyber, we will do this using matplotlib and pandas libraries using jupiter notebook.
On the first phase we will compare different cities grouped by type, urban, suburban and rural to create a summary where we can compare multiple metrics. On a second phase we will review total fares by city types over time grouped by week. After the analysis we will make recommendations to the PyBer CEO for addressig disparities among the city types. 

## Results

### Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types
We can detect from this summary table the urban cities have the highes number of rides, more drivers, and the highest total fares but it is inversely proportional to the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver. The three markets are important for the bussines but if we need to decide where to focuss it has to be on urban areas.

### Total fare by City Type over time
For the Total fare over time we concluded that they are pretty stable across the weeks, we had an spike at the end February for all cities types, probably cause by an special event. Urban areas have less % of variation due to high number of rides.

## Summary

### Recommendations
Average Fare per driver is the highest on Rural areas, we recommend to the CEO to do a further analysis to determine if this behavior is due to a limited number of drivers available causing rates to surge or it is due to customer using rides to move larger distances, if the cause is surged rates we recommend to start a drivers hire campain as we probably are lossing customer.
Urban cities seems to be a high demand area and most of the PyBer income comes from here, we recommend the CEO to focuss on urban areas to have a good customer support to have all customer happy and loyal to PyBer.
We recommend to do more analysis the specific weeks that we had an increment on total fares, is we can determine what drove this behavior and replicate this behavior we can standarize the strategy to increase yearly total fares for PyBer.
